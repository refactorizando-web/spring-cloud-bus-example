== Kafka Configuration

The first step is running kafka, for this we are going to use docker.

=== First Step

```
docker run --rm -p 2181:2181 -p 3030:3030 -p 8081-8083:8081-8083 -p 9581-9585:9581-9585 -p 9092:9092 -e ADV_HOST=localhost landoop/fast-data-dev:latest

```

== Git configuration
Add a file into git, take in mind that you need to use a webhook to make a call to /monitor endpoint.

=== Run the config server
```
mvn spring-boot:run

```

== Client Configuration

Run the project:
```
mvn spring-boot:run

```
