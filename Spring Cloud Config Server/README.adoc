= Config Server with Spring Cloud Bus =

== Introducci√≥n ==
This project born with the idea of connect a spring cloud config server with Spring Cloud Bus and Kafka

== Kafka Configuration

The first step is running kafka, for this we are going to use docker.

=== First Step

```
docker run --rm -p 2181:2181 -p 3030:3030 -p 8081-8083:8081-8083 -p 9581-9585:9581-9585 -p 9092:9092 -e ADV_HOST=localhost landoop/fast-data-dev:latest

```

== Git configuration
Add a file into git, take in mind that you need use a webhook to make a call to /monitor endpoint.


=== Run the server
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
